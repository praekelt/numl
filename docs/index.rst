numl documentation
==================

.. TODO link to numi once we have a thing to link to

numl is a `markup language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language>`_ for defining numi dialogues. It
allows one to read and write numi dialogues similar to how a document would be read and written. A numl document compiles to a `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ description understandable by numi.
